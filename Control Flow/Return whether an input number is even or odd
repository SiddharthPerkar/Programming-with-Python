#Ex. 13 :- Write a function that will take in a number, and return whether it's even or odd.

Hint: You'll need to use the % (modulus) operator to get the remainder when dividing by 2
      to determine if the number is even or odd.

even_or_odd(57) == 'odd'
even_or_odd(2422) == 'even'

Solution :- 

def even_or_odd(a_number):
    if a_number % 2 == 0:
        return 'even'
    return 'odd'
