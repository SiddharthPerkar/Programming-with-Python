#Ex. 18 :- Define a function color_mixer that receives two colors color1 and color2 
           and returns the color resulting from mixing them in EITHER ORDER. 
           The colors received are either red, blue, or yellow and you should return:

Magenta if the colors mixed are red and blue

Green if the colors mixed are blue and yellow

Orange if the colors mixed are yellow and red

Examples:

>>> color_mixer('red', 'blue')
'Magenta'
>>> color_mixer('blue', 'red')
'Magenta'
>>> color_mixer('blue', 'yellow')
'Green'
>>> color_mixer('yellow', 'red')
'Orange'


Solution :-

def color_mixer(color1, color2):
    if color1 == 'red' and color2 == 'blue' or color1 == 'blue' and color2 == 'red':
        return 'Magenta'
    elif color1 == 'blue' and color2 == 'yellow' or color1 == 'yellow' and color2 == 'blue':
        return 'Green'
    elif color1 == 'yellow' and color2 == 'red' or color1 == 'red' and color2 == 'yellow':
        return 'Orange'
