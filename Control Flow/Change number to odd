#Ex. 6 :- Define a function make_number_odd that receives a number,
          adds 1 to that number if it is even, and returns the number.

If the original number passed is odd, just return it.

Hint: Use the % operator to determine if even or odd

Examples:

>>> make_number_odd(2)
3
>>> make_number_odd(5)
5

Solution :- 

def make_number_odd(number):
    if number%2 == 0:
        number +=1
    return number
