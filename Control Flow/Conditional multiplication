Ex. 5 :- Define a function conditional_multiplication that receives a boolean and a number and returns a number. 
If the boolean is True the number returned is multiplied by 10. In other case, it returns it unchanged.

Examples:

# Boolean is True, multiply it by 10
>>> conditional_multiplication(True, 2)
20

# Boolean is False, return it as it is
>>> conditional_multiplication(False, 5)
5

Solution :- 

def conditional_multiplication(a_condition, number):
    if a_condition == True:
        return number*10
    else:
        return number
