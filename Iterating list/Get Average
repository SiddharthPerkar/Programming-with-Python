#Ex. 9 :- Complete the function get_average so that it returns the average of all the numbers in list_of_numbers.

You'll need to use a for loop to calculate the total value of all the numbers added together.

Then divide the total by the amount of items in your list to get your average.

Hint: You'll need a variable to keep track of the total. 
You need to figure out whether that variable belongs inside or outside the for loop.


Solution :- 

def get_average(list_of_numbers):
    total = 0
    avg = []
    for a in list_of_numbers:
        total += a
        avg = total/len(list_of_numbers)
    return avg
