#Ex. 7 :- You've done something similar to this with a while loop, now do it with a for loop!
          You'll have to use the range() function.

Complete powers_of_2 using a for loop so that receives the power and returns 2 to that power.

Examples:

>>> powers_of_2(0)
1

>>> powers_of_2(1)
2


Solution :- 

def powers_of_2(power):
    result = 1
    for num in range(power):
        result *= 2
    return result
