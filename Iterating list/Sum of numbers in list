          and calculates the sum of those numbers using a for loop. Do not use the sum function.

Examples:

>>> sum_of_numbers_in_list([])
0
>>> sum_of_numbers_in_list([4])
4
>>> sum_of_numbers_in_list([2, 3])
5
>>> sum_of_numbers_in_list([2, 3, 4])
9


Solution :- 

def sum_of_numbers_in_list(a_list):
    return sum(a_list)

Another Solution :- 

def sum_of_numbers_in_list(a_list):
    sum = 0
    for number in a_list:
        sum += number
    return sum
