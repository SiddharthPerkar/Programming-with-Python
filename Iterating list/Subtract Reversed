#Ex. 14 :- Using a while loop, write a function subtract_reversed that receives a list 
           and subtracts all the numbers, starting from the end. Example:

subtract_reversed([3, 7, 18]) # Result: 8 (which is equals to: 18 - 7 - 3)
subtract_reversed([9]) # Result: 9 (which is equals to: 9 - 0)

Special case: If the list is empty, should return 0. Check the tests for details.


Solution :- 
  
def subtract_reversed(a_list):
    if len(a_list) == 0:
        return 0

    result = a_list[-1]
    index = 2
    while index <= len(a_list):
        elem = a_list[-1 * index]
        result -= elem
        index += 1

    return result
