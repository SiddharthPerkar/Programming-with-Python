#Guess the number game

answer = 99

users_guess = None
users_guess_int = None

while users_guess_int != answer:
  users_guess = input("Guess a number:")
  users_guess_int = int(users_guess)

print("Guessed Correctly")


Another solution using break statement :- 

answer = 99

users_guess = None
users_guess_int = None

while users_guess_int != answer:
  users_guess = input("Guess a number:")
  if int(users_guess) == 99:
    break

print("Guessed Correctly")


Another Solution using while statement :-

answer = 99

while True:
  users_guess = input("Guess a number:")
  if int(users_guess) == 99:
    break

print("Guessed Correctly")
