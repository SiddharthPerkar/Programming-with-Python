#Ex. 2 :- Write a function called string_of_numbers that receives an integer length and uses a while loop to create and return a string of consecutive numbers from 1 up to the number length.

Examples:

>>>  string_of_numbers(3)
'123'

>>>  string_of_numbers(5)
'12345'


Solution :- 

def string_of_numbers(length):
    number_string = ""
    count = 1
    while count <= length:
        number_string += str(count)
        count += 1
    return number_string
