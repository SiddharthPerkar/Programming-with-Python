Ex. 4 :- Use a while loop to complete the function feel_the_power so that it takes the initial_number 
         and multiplies it by itself power number of times.

Examples:

>>> feel_the_power(3, 0)
1

>>> feel_the_power(3, 1)
3

>>> feel_the_power(3, 2)
9

>>> feel_the_power(3, 3)
27


Solution :- 

def feel_the_power(initial_number, power):
    result = 1
    count = 0
    while count < power :
        result *= initial_number
        count += 1
    return result
