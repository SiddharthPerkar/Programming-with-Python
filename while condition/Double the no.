#Ex. 3 :- Complete the function double_down so that it receives a number num and an integer times_doubled 
  and returns num doubled times_doubled amount of times. Use a while loop to do this.

Examples:

>>>  double_down(3, 3)
24

>>>  double_down(2, 0)
2

>>>  double_down(4, 1)
8


Solution :- 

def double_down(num, times_doubled):
    count = 0
    while count < times_doubled:
        num *= 2
        count += 1
    return num
