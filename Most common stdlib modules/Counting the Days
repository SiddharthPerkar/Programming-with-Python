#Ex. 6 :- The datetime library is useful for much more than just getting and formatting dates!

You can let Python perform mathy calculations for you as well.

For this exercise, create a function counting_the_days that receives a variable start_date and end_date. Subtract start_date from end_date 
and you will produce a timedelta object. To practice using this, return your timedelta object in the format of days using they days method.

Example:

counting_the_days(date(1987, 9, 29), date(2017, 9, 29)) # 10958


Solution :- 

# Import the library here!
from datetime import date

def counting_the_days(start_date, end_date):
    return (end_date - start_date).days


print(counting_the_days(date(1987, 9, 29), date(2017, 9, 29)))
