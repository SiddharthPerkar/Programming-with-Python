#Ex. 15 :- Write a function add_book_to_purchase that receives a dictionary with purchase information 
and adds a book to the given purchase dict. Each purchase dict has a key books that contains a list of books. 
Your job is to append the book to that list.

Example:

purchase = {
    'id': 99,
    'books': [],  # Empty list of books
    'total': 0
}
add_book_to_purchase(
    purchase,
    title='The Odyssey',
    author='Homer',
    price=7.99)
print(purchase)
Prints:

{
    'id': 99,
    'books': [{
        'title': 'The Odyssey',
        'author': 'Homer',
        'price': 7.99
    }],  # The list of books has one book
    'total': 0
}



Solution :- 

def add_book_to_purchase(purchase_dict, title, author, price=0.99):
    purchase_dict['books'].append({
        'title': title,
        'author' : author,
        'price' : price
    })
