#Ex. 12 :- The government wants you to "update" some books (in our case, dictionaries) and 
remove the words with descriptions including certain words. 
Write a function censor_dictionary that receives an dictionary named unclean_dictionary and a string flagged_word. 
If the flagged_word is in the description (value) of a word (key), remove the word (key-value pair) from the dictionary.

Hint: You can use pop or del to remove key-value pairs.

expressions = {
    "pumped": "I'm so darn excited!",
    "happy": "Yeehaw",
    "agreeable": "darn tootin!"
}

assert censor_dictionary(expressions, "darn") == {"happy": "Yeehaw"}


Solution :- 

def censor_dictionary(unclean_dictionary, flagged_word):
    remove_list = []
    for word, description in unclean_dictionary.items():
        if flagged_word in description:
            remove_list.append(word)
    for word in remove_list:
        unclean_dictionary.pop(word)
    return unclean_dictionary
