#Ex. 6 :- Write a function how_many_times that receives a string (like a short sentence text) 
          and a word and returns the number of times that word is repeated in the sentence. 


Example:

phrase = "Python is a great language. I like Python a lot."
how_many_times(phrase, "Python")  # Returns 2


Solution :- 

def how_many_times(a_string, a_word):
    return a_string.count(a_word)
