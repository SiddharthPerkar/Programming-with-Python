#Ex. 6 :- Write a function that receives a list of numbers and a list of terms and returns only the elements that are divisible by ALL the terms.
You must use two nested list comprehensions to solve it.

divisible_numbers([12, 11, 10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1], [2, 3]) == [12, 6]

Warning, this assignment is difficult. If you get stuck, try working it with a for-loop first and then start turning it into list comprehensions.

Solution :- 

def divisible_numbers(a_list, terms):
    return [x for x in a_list if len([1 for term in terms if x % term == 0]) == len(terms)]


Another Solution :- 

def divisible_numbers(a_list, a_list_of_terms):
    return [e for e in a_list if all([e % t == 0 for t in a_list_of_terms])]
