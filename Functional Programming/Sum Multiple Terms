#Ex. 1 :- Write a function that receives multiple arguments and returns the sum of them. Example:

sum_multiple(2, 3, 5, 7) == 17
sum_multiple(2, 3) == 5
If no arguments are provided, an Exception should be raised. Check the test cases for the complete spec.


Solution :- 

def sum_multiple(*args):
    if not args:
        raise AttributeError("You must pass at least one number to sum")
    return sum(args)
