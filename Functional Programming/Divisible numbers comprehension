#Ex. 2 :- Write a function that receives a list of numbers and a term 'n' and returns only the elements that are divisible by that term 'n'. 
You must use List comprehensions to solve it.

divisible_numbers([9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1], 3)  == [9, 6, 3]

Solution :- 

def divisible_numbers(a_list, term):
    return [e for e in a_list if e % term == 0]
