#Ex. 7 :- The objective of this assignment is to write a factorial function (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Factorial).

In order to do that we'll define 2 helper functions:

factorial_terms: will receive a number and return the list of terms to compute the factorial.
compute_factorial: Will receive a list of terms and compute de factorial.
Finally, the factorial function will get a number and, using both helper functions, will compute the answer.

This assignment is designed to practice the reduce function. But if you think it's getting too complicated, you can just try using a for-loop and check the solution later.

Use the tests to see the complete specification of what you're required to write.



Solution :- 

try:
    reduce
except NameError:
    from functools import reduce


def factorial_terms(a_number):
    if a_number < 0:
        raise ValueError("Only defined for positive numbers")
    return list(range(a_number or 1, 0, -1))


def compute_factorial(terms):
    if not terms:
        raise ValueError("Terms should have at least one element")
    return reduce(lambda a, b: a*b, terms, 1)


def factorial(number):
    return compute_factorial(factorial_terms(number))
