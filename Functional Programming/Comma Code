#Ex. 8 :- Write a function that takes a list value as an argument and returns a string with all the items separated by a comma and a space, 
with 'and' inserted before the last item.

Example:

comma_code(['apples', 'bananas', 'tofu', 'cats']) # 'apples, bananas, tofu and cats'
comma_code(['apples', 'bananas']) # 'apples and bananas'
This assignment is also designed to be resolved with a reduce function, but use your common sense to judge it.


Solution :- 

try:
    reduce
except NameError:
    from functools import reduce

def comma_code(a_list):
    return reduce(lambda x, y: x + ", " + y if y != a_list[len(a_list)-1] else x + " and " + y, a_list)
