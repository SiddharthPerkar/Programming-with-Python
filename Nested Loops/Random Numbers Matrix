#Ex. 7 :- Use the random module (more below) to write a function random_matrix that returns a matrix size m Ã— n 
with random numbers (m is the number of rows and n is the number of columns). 
The only restriction is that elements in the matrix CAN'T be repeated, they must be unique. 

Examples:

random_matrix(3, 2)
[
    [29, 11],
    [91, 85],
    [56, 18],
]

random_matrix(4, 4)
[
    [29, 11, 23, 90],
    [91, 85, 92, 75],
    [56, 18, 13, 47],
    [65, 99, 49, 10]
]
Random Numbers
To generate random numbers you can use the random module. It's super simple, check the following example (or try it for yourself):

import random
number = random.randint(0, 100) # A random number between 0 and 100
print(number)


Solution :- 

import random


def _get_random_number_not_repeated(previous_numbers):
    while True:
        number = random.randint(0, 100)
        if number not in previous_numbers:
            return number


def random_matrix(m, n):
    used_numbers = []
    matrix = []

    for i in range(m):
        row = []
        for j in range(n):
            number = _get_random_number_not_repeated(used_numbers)
            row.append(number)
            used_numbers.append(number)
        matrix.append(row)

    return matrix
