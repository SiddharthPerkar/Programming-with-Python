#Ex. 5 :- What? You want more practice with lists?! Geez, you must really like them. Fine.

This time, we're going to expand on the previous assignment.

What's better than a list with one element? A list with three elements. Great!

Use the three word variables word1, word2 and word3 to create a list pizza_time that contains those three words.


Solution :-

word1 = "pizza"
word2 = "burger"
word3 = "cheese burger"

# Now make a list containing each of these words and store in a variable called `pizza_time`.
pizza_time = [word1, word2, word3]
