#Ex. 5 :- Today we're going to write a function to convert what a pirate would say into the way a dog would say it. 
          Roo roo roo roo!

Complete the function convert_pirate_to_dog with a for loop so that it goes through each letter of pirate_saying 
and then adds 'oo' after each letter.

Remember that strings are immutable, so you will have to create a new string for the result of how a dog would sound.

Examples:

>>>  convert_pirate_to_dog("arrrr")
'aoorooroorooroo'


Solution :- 

def convert_pirate_to_dog(pirate_saying):
    res = ""
    for char in pirate_saying:
        res += char
        res += 'oo'
    return res
