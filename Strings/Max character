#Ex. 7 :- Write a function max_char that receives a string and returns the "maximum" character in it.
          Max is defined as a < b < ... < z ignoring uppercase chars (all strings provided will be lowercase).
          Important: If the string received is empty, the result should be an empty string. 
Example:

max_char('azg')  # 'z'
max_char('')  # ''


Solution :- 

def max_char(a_string):
    max_found = None
    for char in a_string:
        if max_found is None or char > max_found:
            max_found = char

    return max_found or ''
