#Ex. 2 :- Write a function that receives a list as input and returns a dictionary 
          that counts how many times the data in the list is repeated.

count_occurrences(["a", "b", "c", "a", "a", "b"])

# {"a" : 3, "b" : 2, "c": 1}


Solution :- 

def count_occurrences(a_list):
    dic = {}
    for a in a_list:
        if a not in dic.keys():
            dic[a] = 1 
        else:
            dic[a] += 1
    return dic
